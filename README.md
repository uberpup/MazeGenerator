# MazeGenerator
Project for MIPT Python course Code Review.

This program draws basic console-drawn labyrints, using rather DFS or minimum spanning tree.
It can also show route between start cell and finish cell and can write a labyrinth in a file "labyrinth.txt".
Minimum spanning tree is concturcted via Kruskal algorithm.

How to use?
1. Enter the size of a labyrint:
   length 
   width
2. Chose the generating mode
3. If you want to download the labyrinth, type:
   YES
4. Decide, whether you want to see the route. In order to do that, type:
   YES
5. In order to download a labyrinth with root, type "YES" again
